for thorough data exploration and understanding before proceeding with preprocessing and analysis. This would involve diving deeper into the characteristics of the datasets, identifying potential challenges, and formulating a well-informed strategy for handling them.

Secondly, I would enhance my documentation practices. Keeping track of each step in the ETL process, the decisions made, and the rationale behind them is crucial for project transparency and future reference. This documentation can serve as a valuable resource not only for my own learning but also for collaboration and sharing with others.

Additionally, I would proactively seek out additional resources and tutorials related to JOIN operations and aggregation techniques. A stronger foundation in these areas would enable me to approach data transformations with more confidence and creativity, leading to more insightful analyses.

In conclusion, this project provided me with hands-on experience in data preprocessing, transformation, and loading. It reinforced the significance of data quality, thorough exploration, and continuous learning. While challenges were encountered, they served as valuable learning opportunities that will undoubtedly shape my approach to future projects.
