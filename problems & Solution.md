1. Data Quality Check:
   The initial step involved assessing the cleanliness and organization of the dataset sourced from Kaggle. After a thorough review, it was established that the dataset was not only clean but also well-structured, meeting the prerequisites for further analysis.

2. Common Column Challenge:
   As part of the project's data preparation phase, a crucial challenge emerged during the merging process. Both datasets contained an identical column named "Returns." This posed a hurdle when attempting to merge the datasets, causing syntax errors.

3. **Discovering the Solution:**
   To overcome the obstacle, I embarked on a research journey, seeking solutions online. Through comprehensive searches and a collaborative effort with the online community, I learned that the "on=" parameter is instrumental in combining datasets that share a common column. This revelation proved to be the key to unlocking successful dataset merging.

4. Successful Merge Implementation:
   Armed with this newfound understanding, I applied the "on = 'Returns'" parameter to the merging process. This action effectively synchronized the datasets based on the "Returns" column, addressing the syntax errors and ensuring a seamless merge.
